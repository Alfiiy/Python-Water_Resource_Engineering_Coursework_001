#name of the river
Brahmaputra River
Brahmaputra is one of the largest river in India. The Brahmaputra River, originating in Tibet and flowing through India and Bangladesh, is a vital waterway known for its cultural significance, ecological diversity, and economic importance.  By itself, it is the 9th largest river in the world by discharge, and the 15th longest. The Ganges–Brahmaputra–Meghna system has the second-greatest average discharge of the world's rivers—roughly ~44,000 m3/s (1,600,000 cu ft/s), and the river Brahmaputra alone supplies about 50% of the total discharge. The rivers' combined suspended sediment load of about 1.87 billion tonnes (1.84 billion tons) per year is the world's highest.
